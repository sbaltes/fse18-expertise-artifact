# Artifact Badge

For the quantitative analysis presented in the [paper](http://empirical-software.engineering/assets/pdf/fse18-expertise.pdf) (see Section 6), we apply for the "Replicated" badge.

Using the artifact, it is also possible to replicate our description of participants' demographics (Table 1, Sections 3.1 and 5.2) and the quantitative data mentioned in Section 5.3.

The main contribution of the paper, the theory presented in Sections 3 to 5, is hard to replicate because it is grounded in qualitative data from three survey samples and in related work from software engineering and psychology (see Section 2 for an overview of the research design). However, we provide our coding schema as [MAXQDA](https://www.maxqda.com/) files (the software we used for the coding) so that other researchers can trace the categories described in the paper to our participants' responses.
