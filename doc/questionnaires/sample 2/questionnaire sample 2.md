#### 15. Please rate your own Java programming expertise according to the five stages described below: 

Stage 1 (Novice):

* has little or no experience
* wants unambiguous rules to accomplish his/her tasks
* is able to handle small, isolated tasks

Stage 2 (Advanced Beginner):

* has gained some experience
* can work more independently than a novice
* knows general principles in a limited context, but does not have a holistic understanding ("big picture")

Stage 3 (Competent):

* has a holistic understanding of the problem domain
* bases his/her work on deliberate planning and extensive past experience
* can apply general maxims (e.g. design patterns) easily to specific contexts

Stage 4 (Proficient):

* has a vast amount of experience that he/she can intuitively apply to new contexts
* can easily differentiate between irrelevant and important details
* constantly reflects on what he/she has done and revises own approach to perform better in the future

Stage 5 (Expert):

* he/she is a major source of knowledge and information for others
* primarily works from his/her intuition
