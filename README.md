## Anonymity

We removed all user names, email addresses, websites, and company names that could identify individual participants. If you observe any information that could identify participants, please immediately inform us (research@sbaltes.com).

## Code frequencies

Please note that the frequencies displayed in MAXQDA may differ from the number of answers we provided in the paper (usually in brackets). The reason for this is that MAXQDA counts the number of codes, but we counted the number of distinct respondents; there may be multiple codes per answer. Moreover, we added up the answers from multiple samples (S2 and S3) for some analyses.
