1,2,4,4,2,,,"The most common case for keeping  hacks  in code long-term has to be politics-oriented design--that is, choosing to implement something in a certain suboptimal way because it is the only way to get a change through to production, politically speaking. Say, for example, I work on team A that is dependent on team B. Now we may require certain functionality from team B's technology, but if they are either too busy to implement it or philosophically disagree that the change should be made, we may need to implement the functionality in a less optimal place in our own code. This happens frequently when you get to the scale of Fortune 100 software companies, where highly-connected  hub  teams are stressed for resources, and smaller teams dependent upon them often have to develop less maintainable workarounds because they cannot get the buy-in to implement the features properly.",Computers are easy.

This is, in many ways, the same naivety kind of naivety one sees in all recent graduates who lack significant real-world work experience.

Its just an idea, and a few documents describing what features the system must have and what features they plan to have. The design keeps on evolving/changing with every new difficulty. The developer has to come up with some architecture on the fly to a given task. And in most cases she/he herself has to validate it across various scenarios. Validation can be difficult and at times it fails. So, in general while working in fast paced environment where no formal architectures have been given we mostly try to identify the components of the system, since identifieng them won't take much time. After there identification, every developer works on her own component and develops the interface(OO not the UI) and then we sit together to find how easily they can integrate, any bugs, corner cases etc. I don't prefer such loose dynamic designs, but in the startups we have time pressure, delivering the product changing/adding functionality is at a very fast pace and we have to cope up.
